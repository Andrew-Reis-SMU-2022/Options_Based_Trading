# Options_Based_Trading
This program analyzes unusual options activity by using a weighted average based on a trade's volume to compare all of the unusual otm option trades for a expiration date for a given stock.

the daily_report.py and week_report.py (when I get to it) are the current scripts that I use. 

The program takes any number of .csv files in the data folder, extracts the data from them, and outputs data to an excel file called output in the output folder.
